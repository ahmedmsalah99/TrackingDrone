ocsort ->

1- applied manually these fixes: https://github.com/noahcao/OC_SORT/pull/129
2- Fixed ocsort library by replacing normal pointer in kalman filter by share pointer.



Video Manage ->

1- Frames are displayed in the same rate as current Frames.
2- Tracked detections should have the same rate as frames too.


Model target:
1- Detect veichles well from sides and top-view
2- Detect people well from top and side-view

Strategy:
1- Find a model that is trained well for self-driving cars for example
2- Collect top-view data
3- Train the model on the new data as well as old data to keep ot from forgetting
4- test it on both


Can't find a model
Strategy:
1- prepare a dataset (unified)
2- Train a model on them

if want to install again:

git clone https://github.com/ZhenshengLee/ros2_shm_msgs.git
git clone https://github.com/ahmedmsalah99/TrackingDrone.git --branch main

place the model and the onnxruntime folders inside the detection and mot module
place the video in the moc video publisher part
